# Multi-Project Repository

This repository is a collection of Java projects demonstrating various aspects of software development, ranging from simple console applications to more complex web-based systems. Each project is designed to showcase different programming concepts, including object-oriented programming, data persistence, GUI development, and web application development with database integration.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Guess the Number

A simple Java console application where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and it includes features such as a limited number of attempts and scoring based on performance.

**Key Features:**
- Random number generation
- User input via console
- Scoring and limited attempts

### 2. Banky - Basic Banking System

A simulation of a basic banking system that allows for the creation of accounts, and the deposit, withdrawal, and transfer of funds between accounts. It demonstrates object-oriented programming principles, data persistence using files, and basic transaction handling.

**Key Features:**
- Account management
- Transaction processing
- Data persistence with file I/O

### 3. Online Examination System

A Java application that facilitates online exams with functionalities like login, profile management, MCQs answering, a timer with auto-submit, and session management.

**Key Features:**
- User authentication
- Timer-based exam submission
- Session management

### 4. Digital Library Management

A web-based application aimed at digitizing library operations including book-keeping, issuing, fine management, and report generation. The system is split into two modules, one for admin control and another for user interactions.

**Key Features:**
- Web-based interface
- Database integration for persistent storage
- Admin and user module differentiation

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Java Swing/AWT for GUI-based applications
- Servlets/JSP for web-based applications
- MySQL/SQLite for database management

## Installation and Running

Please refer to each project's individual directory for specific instructions on how to install and run the application. Generally, the Java projects require a JDK environment, while web-based applications might need a Tomcat server setup and a configured database.
